      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Offline Games : Blind Maze</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information
        when you use our mobile application (the “App”). We designed the App to work offline and to collect as little data
        as possible.
      </p>

      <div class="notice">
        <strong>Plain-English summary:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not sell your personal information.</li>
          <li>We do not collect precise location data.</li>
          <li>We do not require account creation.</li>
          <li>If analytics/ads are enabled later, we will update this policy.</li>

      <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>

      <h3>1.1 Information you provide</h3>
      <p>
        We do not require you to provide personal information to use the App (such as name, email address, or phone number).
        If you contact us by email, we will receive the information you include in your message.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Information collected automatically</h3>
      <p>
        By default, the App is intended to function offline and does not automatically collect personal information.
        However, depending on your distribution platform and device settings, the platform (e.g., an app store) may
        collect certain information under its own policies.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Device permissions</h3>
      <p>
        The App does not request sensitive permissions such as location, contacts, microphone, or camera unless clearly
        required for an explicit feature. If a future version adds permissions, we will disclose them here.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
      <p>We use information only to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Respond to your support requests if you contact us</li>
        <li>Operate and maintain the App</li>
        <li>Improve stability and performance (if diagnostic logs are ever enabled)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. Data storage and retention</h2>
      <p>
        Game progress and settings may be stored locally on your device (for example, using local storage).
        We do not receive that local data unless you voluntarily send it to us (e.g., via support email).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you email us, we retain messages as long as necessary to respond and for reasonable support recordkeeping.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. We do not share personal information with third parties except:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If required by law, regulation, or legal process</li>
        <li>To protect rights, safety, and security of users and the App</li>
        <li>If you explicitly request or consent to sharing</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        The App may be distributed through third-party platforms (such as an app store). Those platforms may collect
        information independently. Please review their privacy policies for details.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Current status:</strong> The App does not integrate third-party analytics SDKs or advertising SDKs by default.
        If we add services like analytics, crash reporting, or ads, we will update this policy with the provider names and links.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>6. Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The App is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
        If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards appropriate to the nature of the App.
        No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; therefore we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <p>
